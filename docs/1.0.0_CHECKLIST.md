## A. Contract Freeze
- [ ] Entropy formula (component definitions) unchanged and documented.
- [ ] Component weights (0.30 / 0.25 / 0.20 / 0.15 / 0.10) frozen.
- [ ] CLI commands/flags frozen (`evaluate`, `validate-config`, `pr-summary`).
- [ ] Exit codes (0, 1, 2, 3) confirmed and documented.
- [ ] Policy/decision/requirement YAML schemas frozen; migration guidance ready if changes occur post-1.0.

## B. Stability Validation
- [ ] Determinism suites passing (context, diagnostics, CLI JSON).
- [ ] Repeat-run JSON comparison identical for representative files.
- [ ] Stress test: ≥50 files, ≥100 policies, ≥30 decisions, ≥50 requirements evaluated without degradation.
- [ ] `state.json` corruption tests passing (missing, invalid, partial).
- [ ] No super-linear performance regressions detected.

## C. Governance Validation
- [ ] Real-world feedback collected from early adopters.
- [ ] CI integrations (evaluate/validate-config/pr-summary) exercised across target platforms.
- [ ] Entropy/ETI monitoring shows no oscillation or rounding issues.

## D. Release Discipline
- [ ] CHANGELOG and documentation aligned with final state.
- [ ] README / PHILOSOPHY / DESIGN_PRINCIPLES updated.
- [ ] ROADMAP reflects post-1.0 direction or is archived.
- [ ] Git tag/release notes drafted and verified against frozen contracts.
